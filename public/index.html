          <p class="prologue">
            <strong>Boris “The Bandit” Ronson</strong> was an infamous outlaw
            for all the wrong reasons. He was bumbling at best - he was as
            bright as rusted iron, he couldn't pour water out of a boot with the
            instructions on the heel… But he was your brother and that meant
            that when he got into trouble with the law, it was your job to get
            him out again.

            Rumour has it that Boris had been at an illegal shindig somewhere
            down south the night before last. The law had caught wind of it and
            had stormed the place, arresting every Tom, Dick and Harry who
            hadn’t managed to hightail it out of there and ofcourse, Boris had
            been one of the ones who had been as drunk as a skunk, so much so
            that he hadn’t even been able to mount his horse and make a getaway.
            Hauled down to the <span class="geo-city"></span> Sheriff’s Office
            where, if you don’t go sharpish, he’ll swing come the morning!

              You haven’t been here for a while but it’s just the way you
              remember it - a dusty little town with a generous sized watering
              hole at the heart of it called The Cowpoke Saloon. The ride here
              had been a long one; your back hurt and quite frankly, you were
              parched so you hitched your reliable old horse and went in through
              the swing doors into the saloon. Another hour wouldn’t kill Boris…
              Hopefully.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your footsteps are loud on the aged wooden floorboards and your
              spurs make a pleasant jingling sound as you walk. It’s enough to
              turn the heads of the patrons inside The Cowpoke Saloon, all who
              survey this stranger with differing levels of interest and
              suspicion. You’ve been around the block enough times as to not let
              the stares disconcert you - you walk into the saloon as if you
              belong there.
            </p>
            <p>
              You notice an intriguing looking <strong>fellow</strong> sitting
              at a circular table alone, shuffling a deck of cards with
              white-gloved hands. He stands out because he is so well dressed in
              comparison to the other day drinkers; he wears a top hat, a baby
              blue silk waistcoat with a pocket watch. His eyes which catch
              yours for the merset of moments, are a bright emerald green and
              his dark moustache is waxed and turned up at the corners with the
              utmost precision.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the bar there is a round-faced <strong>barman</strong> with
              rosy cheeks cleaning glasses idly. He acknowledges you and you
              start forwards.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Hey there handsome, you lookin’ for some company?” A buxom
              <strong>redhead</strong> asks you. She’s standing by a wide wooden
              staircase that leads to the upper floor of the saloon. As you look
              at her, she has a devilish gleam in her eye.

          <div class="redhead-intro">
            <p>
              You smile at the redhead, “depends on who’s asking.” “That’s for
              me to know and you to find out,” she replies without missing a
              beat. “Now, are you really gonna make a girl beg?” You shake your
              head, “of course not.” “That’s what I like to hear, sugar.” She
              holds her hand out to you and you accept it as she begins to make
              her way up the stairs and you follow. The din from the bar is
              quickly left behind you as you find yourself in a hallway lined
              with pictures of the town and famous people who had visited the
              saloon in years gone by. There’s carpet up here, red and plush
              under your boots and your spurs don’t even make a sound now. It
              strikes you just how quiet it is. The redhead seems to know
              exactly where she’s going and stops before a room: 2b. She’s
              finding the key to unlock it but something about all of this has
              made you feel uneasy…

              She manages to open the door and you step inside the room which
              unlike the rest of the upstairs is remarkably bare besides a bed.
              You don’t have time to consider this as there’s suddenly a pain in
              your back. You whirl around to see that the woman who you had
              thought had been fumbling for a key actually holds a knife. It’s
              now a bloody knife. Your blood. You fall forward face first onto
              the bed and she quickly relieves you of all your money and
              valuables. I guess you should never judge a book by it's cover.

              You lean against the bar and order a whiskey. “Haven’t seen you
              ‘round here before.” The barman says as he sets the drink down.
              You shrug and slug it in one. “Just passin’ through.” Although you
              have enough money on you to drink the bar dry at least twice over,
              you really should start thinking about setting dear Boris free…
              But one more couldn’t hurt, right?

          <div class="bar-end">
            One whiskey quickly becomes two, three and four and before you know
            it, the room is spinning faster than the wheel of a stagecoach. You
            manage to stumble outside the back of the saloon and see that
            there’s no daylight to be found, it’s dark out now - how long have
            you been here?!
            <p>
              You puke onto the floor before staggering blindly forwards,
              tripping over something or other - most likely your own feet and
              landing flat on your back, looking up at the navy coloured sky
              before passing out.
            </p>
            <p>
              You wake up with a jolt. Someone’s thrown a bucket of cold water
              over you and shouted at you to get out of the way. It’s bright
              again. People are bustling about their daily business. What time
              was it?! How long had you been asleep?!
            </p>
            <p>
              When you run to the square where they keep the gallows you see
              that you’re too late. The hangings for today had been bright and
              early and while you had slept in a drunken stupor, your brother
              had died.

            <p>
              You go to leave the saloon but the mysterious man at the circular
              table calls out to you: <br />“wait one moment! Why don’t you play
              a round of cards with me?”<br />
              You turn back to face him, “sorry, I ain't got time-”<br />
              “Nonsense!” He said, cutting you off, “sit with me, dear boy.”<br />
              You go to the table, those dazzling eyes fixed on yours. “Listen,
              mister, I got important business to attend to, I’m afraid I don’t
              got time for your little card game.”<br />
              The man smirked at you in a knowing way, his eyes twinkled,
              “you’re here to save your brother from the rope tomorrow.”<br />
              Your eyes widened at this, how could he have known that?!<br />
              “I think I have some information that could help you in your
              endeavour and I’d be prepared to share it with you *if* you play a
              game with me.”<br />
              With uncertainty, you sit down, “what kind of game?”<br />
              “It’s simple, really. I’ll draw a card and all you have to do is
              tell me the correct suit. If you get it wrong, you buy me a drink.
              If you’re right… Well then, I’ll give you the information that
              will help procure your dear brother.”<br />It seems like a scam to
              you but if he really did have information that could help you.
              You’d rather have it than not.<br />
              With his deft, gloved hands, the man shuffles the deck of cards
              before you before fanning them out in one graceful movement on the
              table. He picks one out seemingly at random and peers at it.<br />
              A smirk tugs at the side of his lips.<br />
              “All you have to do is pick what suit you think it is.”

              knowledge to you. Sheriff Broad is guardian of your dear, sweet
              brother as we so speak, however… it has come to my attention that
              he leaves his post every night without fail to visit a Mrs Cahill
              who lives the next town over. I have it on good authority that the
              Sheriff is gone from 11pm - 3 am…. Before Mr Cahill returns from
              his night shift at the railway station, if you catch my

            <p>You do indeed.</p>
            <p>
              You thank the mysterious gentleman and leave the saloon. As you do
              so, you check your pocket watch and see that it is already 10pm so
              you settle outside the bank which is opposite the Sheriffs office
              and wait until you see him leave, just like the mysterious
              gentleman said he would, at 11pm and not a minute later.

              propped up against the back wall. However, sitting behind the desk
              with his feet up and cleaning his revolver, is the Sherrif’s
              Deputy. <br />You hadn’t bet on that and nor had the mysterious
              man told you about him! You had half a mind to go back to the
              saloon and shove those playing cards where the sun didn’t shine
              but that could wait, right now you had to come up with a plan.

              You walk into the Sheriff’s office and flash the man a smile that
              you hoped was charming but he eyes you with suspicion. He’s
              younger than you might have imagined.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Depty! I’m so glad you’re here!” You say, standing before the
              desk. “Why would that be?” He asks, dark beady eyes narrowing.
              “Well, you see, that there in the cell behind you is my poor, baby
              brother. He ain’t the brightest spark unfortunately and I’m sure
              whatever he did to land himself in here is something he’s *very*
              sorry about.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The deputy rolls his eyes as if he’s heard this a thousand times
              before and you don’t doubt that. He sets his revolver down on the
              desk and taps his fingers impatiently as you continue.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I was hoping that we could iron out this *misunderstanding*” You
              say and you put your hand into your jacket pocket and pull out
              around half of the dollar bills you have on you - it’s a good job
              you saved them and didn’t spend it all on liquor at the saloon.
              You slide them across the desk towards the Deputy.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Are you tryin’ to bribe me, son?” he asks and you shrug, “I will
              have you know that it is an offence to bribe a lawman, you know
              that, don’t you?” You’ve been hoping that perhaps the Deputy would
              not mind this but it seemed he did as rose to his feet and you
              were frogmarched to the cell where Boris is happily snoozing
              obliviously and locked in with him.

            “Deputy! I’m so glad you’re here!” You cry theatrically, standing
            before the desk. The Deputy sits up at your sudden arrival.
            <br />
            “There’s some kinda rukkus goin’ on behind the bank!” You tell him,
            “What kinda rukkus?” He asks. “I ain’t too sure. Y-you don’t suppose
            someone’s tryin’ to rob it do you!?” The Deputy is getting to his
            feet now and holstering his revolver. “I was going to take care of
            it myself but then I thought I’d leave it in the *capable*hands of
            the law.” You tell him. “You did the right thing there, son.” He
            says as he grabs his hat and darts out of the office and across the
            street. “Just doing my best as a concerned citizen!” You call after
            him.
